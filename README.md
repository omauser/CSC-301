# Overview
A simple python project that requires the user to input a number to determine if that number is even, odd or zero. Taking into consideration values that are not numbers that could output an error message

# How it works
1. The python file "check number.py" is run
2. User enters number when prompted
3. the program outputs if the number inputed is an even or odd or zero.
4. if thers's an invalid input, an appropriate message is displayed to ensure user enters a number.
