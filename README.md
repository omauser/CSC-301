A simple python project that requires the user to input a number to determine if that number is even, odd or zero. Taking into consideration values that are not numbers that could output an error message

# How it works
1. first the python file "check number.py" is run
2. User enters number when prompted
3. the program will output if the number inputed is an even number or an odd number or zero.
4. if thers's an invalid input, an appropriate message is displayed to ensure user enters a number.

# Notes
Python 3.x is required to run the program
